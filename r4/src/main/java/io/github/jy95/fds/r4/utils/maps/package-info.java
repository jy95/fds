/**
 * Mapping helpers and lookup tables for R4 utilities.
 *
 * <p>This package provides map-based utilities (for example: key-to-extractor
 * maps, code-to-display maps, and other immutable lookup structures) used
 * by the R4 adapters and translators. Centralizing such maps helps keep the
 * conversion logic declarative and easy to update when FHIR or code-system
 * behaviours change.</p>
