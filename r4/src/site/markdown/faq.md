<details>
    <summary>Does this library support FHIR R4B release ?</summary>
    <p>
        Yes. According
        <a href="https://hapifhir.io/hapi-fhir/docs/getting_started/r4b.html">HAPI FHIR</a>,
        R4B is mainly identical to FHIR R4 but with specific resources backported from R5.
        You might need to cast your params to R4 through, as support for FHIR R4B is experimental on HAPI FHIR.
